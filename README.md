About Zsh
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before use `zsh` as a script, you should install `proxychains4`(to use Windows'
proxy) and install `oh-my-zsh` byï¼š

```shell
px wget https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh
```

After setup `oh-my-zsh`, it is a good idea to get plugin `zsh-autosuggestions`,
so follow the [link](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
